# K Vitrimer Analysis

**Kinetic Analysis of Vitrimer Relaxation & Kinetics** - Professional stress relaxation analysis software for materials research.

## No-Code Launch (Windows)

**Easiest method:**
1) Install Python 3.11+ from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ (check "Add python.exe to PATH").
2) Download/unzip the release, then double-click `K_Vitrimer_Analysis.bat`.
3) Wait for dependencies to install (first run only), then your browser opens at `http://localhost:8501`.
4) Keep the terminal window open; press Ctrl+C to stop.

**Alternative (with virtual environment):**
Double-click `run_app.bat` to create a `.venv` and run in isolated environment.

For other platforms, run: `pip install -r requirements.txt; streamlit run can_relax/gui/app.py`

---

**Note:** PyInstaller EXE builds are experimental due to Streamlit compatibility issues. For best results, use the BAT launchers above.
